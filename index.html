        <h3>Freelance Files</h3>
        <h4>Oct 25, 2022, 12 min read</h4>
        <h5>If you’re wondering how to become a freelance writer, the first thing to realize is that there’s no
            one-size-fits-all approach. Only one thing’s for certain: you’ll be in a much better position if you take
            the time to do your research, predict possible roadblocks, and learn from fellow freelancers.
            Whether you’re looking to achieve full independence and say “See ya!” to your nine-to-five, or simply want a
            side-hustle, you’ll need to understand the freelance field inside-out: the good, the bad, and the ugly.
            In this post, I’ll share what I wish I knew when first starting as a freelancer, hurdles to look out for,
            and the opportunities you should be ready to seize.
            My Freelance Writing Story
            I began exploring freelance writing in the small hours of a 2020 spring morning while frantically scrolling
            through twitter. It was that stage of the pandemic when we were just realizing that COVID-19 wouldn’t be a
            one hit wonder.
            Somewhere between the banana bread-baking frenzy of early March and finishing my masters thesis on my best
            friend’s couch, I began to take note of the headlines gliding through my twitter newsfeed. “New grads likely
            to be hit hardest by lockdown recession” was the order of the day.</h5>
